== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed version 1.2 or 1.3 of the plugin and apparently it does not track likes =
Version 1.2 and 1.3 of the plugin had a bug on plugin activation. Is solved in version 1.4 and above. Please update your plugin

= Why does not appear the like button in the frontend? =
Plugin waits for **bbp_theme_before_reply_admin_links** action. Check your theme for this action. Another solutions is to add manually a call to the function that shows the button: **bbp_like_button()**.

= Where can I find plugin support? =
You can ask questions about the plugin in the plugin official site: [bbPress Like Button](http://jordiplana.com/bbpress-like-button-plugin)
